        //
        //     SSSDW    (SSS = 3 bit next state, D = direction, w = write)
        //
        // What we want to know whether `SSS == N` for any of those actions. To
        // do that, we first mask away the direction and write bits
        // (see `state_mask` and `shifted_states`). Now our bitstring looks
        // like this:
        //
        //     ...00 SSS00 SSS00 SSS00
        //
        // The idea is to add just the right number to each of the 3 bit numbers
        // and check overflow. The two 0 bits allow us to handle all
        // independently from one another by just adding one big 64 bit number.
        // Also note that in the front, we have 4 unused (and now 0) bits.
        //
        // In particular, we add a number X such that `N + X = 0b1000`, i.e. the
        // addition carries into the 4th bit. For sections where `SSS < N`,
        // `SSS + X` will result in something smaller than `0b1000`, i.e. a 3
        // bit number.
        //
        // So imagine N is 4 (0b100) and we have this input:
        //
        //    ...00 01100 10000 00100
        //
        // The three example actions in this input transition to state 0b11, the
        // halt state and state 0b1 (in this order).
        //
        // Our adder is `0b1000 - N = 0b100Â´, repeated like this:
        //
        //    ...10000 10000 10000
        //
        // Adding those two together gives:
        //
        //    ...00 11101 00000 10100
        //
        // Finally, we just need to mask away all non-overflow bits with this
        // mask:
        //
        //    ...11 00011 00011 00011      (!state_mask)
        //
        // Resulting in:
        //
        //    ...00 00001 00000 00000
        //
        // And now we simply check whether that result is 0. If it isn't, there
        // has to be a halt state transition somewhere, otherwise the addition
        // would not have overflowed into bit 4.
        //
        // Credits to Julian Kniephoff for coming up with this idea.
        //
        // Oh and we could hardcode `::<6>` here to create the masks since the
        // upper bits are just unused and therefore 0. However, for `add` and
        // `and` instructions, there is no form with a 64bit immediate, so by
